# Snake Game

## Description
This project is a basic Snake Game implemented in C. The player controls the snake, which moves around the screen to fetch food. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake entangles itself by running into its own body. A unique feature of this game is that as the snake eats more food, its speed increases, making the game more challenging and interesting.
